### Step 1: **Understanding Prompt Basics**

**Examples and Activity Expansion**:

1. **Open-ended prompts** invite broader responses, often yielding detailed or creative answers.
    
    - _Example_: "What is artificial intelligence?"
        - _Expected Output_: AI might describe various aspects, like its definition, applications, and future potential, as there is no specific constraint on the answer.
2. **Closed-ended prompts** typically result in shorter, more direct responses.
    
    - _Example_: "Does AI impact healthcare?"
        - _Expected Output_: Likely a "Yes" or "No" answer, possibly with a brief explanation, as the prompt leads to a definitive response.
3. **Directive prompts** specify exactly what type of response is expected.
    
    - _Example_: "List three applications of AI in education."
        - _Expected Output_: A clear, structured list such as “1) Automated grading, 2) Personalized learning, 3) Virtual tutors.”

**Debrief**:  
Discuss how each prompt style frames the AI’s response, showing that specificity can guide the AI toward a more predictable structure. Participants should observe that open-ended prompts offer flexibility, closed-ended ones provide clarity, and directives give control over the response structure.

### Step 2: **Using Instructions and Constraints**

**Examples and Activity Expansion**:

1. Begin with a **general prompt** and add layers of specificity through constraints.
    
    - _Base Prompt_: “Describe a day in Paris.”
    - **With Perspective Constraint**: “Describe a day in Paris from the perspective of a backpacker.”
        - _Expected Output_: Mention of budget-friendly activities, local eateries, free or low-cost attractions.
    - **With Contextual Constraint**: “Describe a rainy day in Paris with sensory details.”
        - _Expected Output_: Descriptions of raindrops on cobblestone streets, the smell of wet earth, cozy cafés, and the sound of rain on rooftops.
2. **Applying Constraints to Tone and Length**:
    
    - _Example Prompt_: “Describe a day in Paris for an art student.”
        - **Constraint on Length**: “Describe a day in Paris for an art student in three sentences.”
        - **Tone Constraint**: “Describe a day in Paris for an art student in an enthusiastic tone.”

**Debrief**:  
Encourage participants to reflect on how constraints direct the response. Discuss how specificity helps in scenarios where detailed or focused answers are needed, such as for professional writing or instructional content.

### Step 3: **Iterating on Prompts for Refinement**


**Examples and Activity Expansion**:

1. **Refinement through Clarity and Audience Adaptation**:
    
    - _Initial Prompt_: “Explain blockchain to a child.”
        - _Expected Output_: May result in a simplified explanation, but could lack accessibility for a young audience.
    - **Refinement 1**: “Explain blockchain to a 10-year-old in simple language.”
        - _Expected Output_: A clearer, simpler explanation using terms a child could understand.
    - **Refinement 2**: “Explain blockchain to a 10-year-old using a story about kids trading cards.”
        - _Expected Output_: A narrative approach using relatable elements like “trading cards” to make the concept of blockchain more accessible.
2. **Iterating for Specific Details**:
    
    - _Initial Prompt_: “Describe how a car engine works.”
        - **Refinement**: “Describe how a car engine works, focusing on how fuel is converted to motion in simple terms.”
        - **Further Refinement**: “Describe how a car engine works for a beginner, without technical jargon, in under 100 words.”

**Debrief**:  
Participants should note how each refinement step enhances relevance, clarity, and audience appropriateness. Emphasize that prompt iteration is crucial in professional settings to meet client needs or align with brand voice.

### Step 4: **Adding Style, Tone, and Perspective**

**Examples and Activity Expansion**:

1. **Adjusting Tone and Style**:
    
    - _Example Prompt_: “Write a summary of climate change impacts.”
        - **Formal Tone**: “Write a formal summary on the impacts of climate change.”
            - _Expected Output_: Structured, factual tone with emphasis on key statistics and scientific findings.
        - **Conversational Tone**: “Explain the impacts of climate change in a conversational style.”
            - _Expected Output_: Friendly, relatable language that feels more accessible, using everyday terms and examples.
2. **Experimenting with Perspective**:
    
    - _Example_: “Describe the benefits of exercise.”
        - **First-Person**: “Describe the benefits of exercise from a personal trainer’s perspective.”
        - **Third-Person**: “Write a third-person overview of the benefits of exercise.”

**Debrief**:  
Have participants share how tone and perspective affected the engagement level or authority of the responses. Discuss how they could use tone and perspective in real-world applications, such as brand messaging or technical support.

### Step 5: **Exploring Advanced Prompt Techniques**

**Examples and Activity Expansion**:

1. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:
    
    - _Problem Prompt_: “How would you organize a fundraiser event?”
        - _Refined Prompt_: “First, list the resources needed for a fundraiser, then suggest a timeline, and finally, outline promotion ideas.”
        - _Expected Output_: A structured response covering each part of the event planning process in sequence, leading to a logical and organized answer.
2. **Example-based Prompting**:
    
    - _Base Prompt_: “Draft an email inviting colleagues to a team-building event.”
        - **Example-Driven Prompt**: Provide a sample invitation email, then prompt, “Now, write an invitation for a holiday party in the same style.”
        - _Expected Output_: The AI mimics the sample email structure, applying it to the new scenario with similar tone and format.

**Debrief**:  
Discuss how advanced techniques improve response depth, especially in complex prompts. Emphasize that these methods are useful for tasks requiring logical sequencing or adherence to a specific format.
